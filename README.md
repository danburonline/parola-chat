# Parola Chat

Parola Chat is an advertisement framework to develop cross-website conversational experiences â€“ even with Swiss German natural language processing.

## Goal

The goal of Parola Chat is to engage and encourage users throughout the whole customer journey; from the first touchpoint up to a purchase and beyond.

## Expectation

You can expect a full-stack application; front-end written with React, back-end written in TypeScript, running on Node, and with data from a MongoDB database. As a NLP framework, I will use Google Cloud Platform's DialogFlow.
