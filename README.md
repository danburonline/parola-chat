**Parola Chat is a full-stack advertisement framework** to develop encrypted cross-website conversational experiences with Swiss German natural language understanding/processing.

## Introduction

To be continued.

## Goal

Parola Chat's goal is to engage and encourage users throughout the whole customer journey; from the first touchpoint up to a purchase and beyond. All without the need for cookies and everything without violating the privacy of the users.

## Expectation

The Parola application is a full-stack NextJS/MERN app. I mainly used TypeScript throughout the whole project. The database of choice is MongoDB (DaaS is [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)), and as the NLP framework, I used the Google Cloud Platform's [DialogFlow CX API](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs). Keep in mind that I utilised a paid server-side fingerprinting service called [FingerprintJS Pro](https://fingerprintjs.com) for the cookie-less authentication. You can always use the free version of FingerprintJS if needed. Just be sure to change the code a little (more information in the setup section). I highly recommend running Parola on an IaaS provider since it needs to be highly scalable and handle a lot of traffic.
